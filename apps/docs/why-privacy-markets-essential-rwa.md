# Why Privacy Markets Are Essential for RWA Trading

![DuskPool N Stellar](/blog-assets/duskpoolnstellar.png)
When large trades happen in public markets, everyone sees the intent—and the price often moves before the trade is done. That's why private venues exist in traditional finance: to allow big orders to be executed without broadcasting the size or direction to the market.

As tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) grow, this problem gets bigger. RWAs are often less liquid, larger in size, and more sensitive to timing and disclosure. At the same time, institutional participation is accelerating, bringing real-world trading behavior on-chain.

That creates a clear need: **private execution with on-chain settlement**.

- **Private execution** means orders can be matched without exposing intent.
- **On-chain settlement** means the trade can still be final, auditable, and fair once it clears.

This is why we believe privacy markets are essential for RWA trading. They protect participants from information leakage, reduce market impact, and make it possible to move real size without destabilizing the market.

## Why Build This on Stellar?

DuskPool is building on Stellar because the network is now explicitly enabling zero-knowledge (ZK) applications through **Protocol 25 (X-Ray)**. X-Ray introduces native cryptographic primitives to Soroban that make privacy-preserving markets practical on-chain.

Two upgrades matter most:

1. **BN254 host functions** enable efficient on-chain verification of zk-SNARK proofs.
2. **Poseidon and Poseidon2 host functions** provide ZK-friendly hashing for commitments, Merkle trees, and nullifiers—core building blocks of private trading systems.

## ERC-3643 and Compliant RWAs

We also like that the Stellar Development Foundation joined the **ERC-3643 Association**, a standard focused on compliant, permissioned tokenization for RWAs. SDF's participation signals a serious commitment to interoperability, compliance, and institutional-grade asset issuance—which aligns with the market structure DuskPool is building.

## The Future of RWAs

The future of RWAs isn't just tokenization—it's **market structure**.

DuskPool is building a privacy market layer so institutions can trade at size without leaking intent, while still settling transparently on-chain. That balance is what real-world adoption needs—and it's why we chose Stellar.
