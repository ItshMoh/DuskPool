# Matching Engine

Off-chain order matching engine for the dark pool.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Overview

The matching engine runs off-chain to find matching buy and sell orders. It maintains an in-memory order book and matches orders based on asset and price compatibility.

Since order details are hidden in commitments, the matching engine works with the order parameters provided during submission. In a production system, traders would submit encrypted order details to the matching engine while only the commitment goes on-chain.

## Usage

```typescript
import { MatchingEngine, Order, OrderSide } from "./src/index";

const engine = new MatchingEngine();

// Add buy order
const buyOrder: Order = {
  id: "order-1",
  commitment: "0x...",
  trader: "GBUYER...",
  assetAddress: "CASSET...",
  side: OrderSide.Buy,
  quantity: BigInt(100_000_000),
  price: BigInt(50_000_000),
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  expiry: Date.now() + 3600000,
};
engine.addOrder(buyOrder);

// Add sell order
const sellOrder: Order = {
  id: "order-2",
  commitment: "0x...",
  trader: "GSELLER...",
  assetAddress: "CASSET...",
  side: OrderSide.Sell,
  quantity: BigInt(100_000_000),
  price: BigInt(50_000_000),
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  expiry: Date.now() + 3600000,
};
engine.addOrder(sellOrder);

// Find matches
const matches = engine.findMatches();
// Returns array of { buyOrder, sellOrder, matchedQuantity, executionPrice }
```

## Matching Logic

Orders match when they have the same asset, compatible prices (buy price >= sell price), and are not expired. The execution price is the average of the two prices. Partial fills are supported.

## Integration

After finding a match, the matching engine coordinates with the prover to generate a settlement proof, then submits the settlement transaction to the orderbook and settlement contracts.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test
```
